## Executive Summary
As of October 2023, Apple Inc. holds a substantial market capitalization of approximately $3 trillion, indicating a robust position in the technology sector. However, the company has faced four consecutive quarters of declining sales, the longest in over two decades, primarily driven by shrinking demand for iPhones. Despite these challenges, Apple continues to innovate through research and development investments exceeding $500 billion and explores new avenues such as the automotive sector.
